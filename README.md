# Hello

My name is Pav Rao. I'm currently at Makers Academy, a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp, with the hope of landing a job as a junior full stack developer after I finish. Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics MSci, had a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and have been performing stand-up comedy across the UK and Europe since 2011.

I've been learning JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, Sinatra, Capybara, data structures and algorithms, and have dipped my toe into React and C.
