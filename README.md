# Hello

My name is Pav Rao. I've just finished Makers Academy, a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp, and hope to land a job as a junior full stack developer after I finish. Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics MSci, had a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and have been performing stand-up comedy across the UK and Europe since 2011.

I've been learning JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL, Sinatra, Capybara, data structures and algorithms, and am competent using Git and GitHub.. I'm a big fan of TDD and have tested with Jest, Jasmine, React Testing Library and RSpec.
