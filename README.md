# Hello

My name is Pav Rao. I'm a full-stack software engineer and currently work at Mumsnet. In September 2021 I finished Makers, a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp. Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics MSci, had a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy across the UK and Europe.

At Mumsnet I use Laravel, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire and MySQL. I have experience with JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS, and have dabbled with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node, Express, Sinatra, Capybara, and data structures and algorithms. I've also tested with phpunit, Jest, Jasmine, React Testing Library and RSpec.

More information on my experience, education history, independent code reviews and references, can be found on my [GitHub CV](https://github.com/pav0107/CV/).
