# Hello

My name is Pav Rao. I'm a full-stack software engineer and have just started my first job at Mumsnet. In September 2021 I finished Makers, a 16-week intensive coding bootcamp. Prior to Makers, I graduated with a degree in Physics with Astrophysics MSci, had a career as an advertising creative/copywriter and performed stand-up comedy across the UK and Europe since 2011.

I've used JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire, Sinatra, Capybara, data structures and algorithms, and am competent using Git and GitHub. I'm a big fan of TDD and have tested with Jest, Jasmine, React Testing Library and RSpec.

More information on my experience, education history, independent code reviews and references, can be found on my [GitHub CV](https://github.com/pav0107/CV/)
